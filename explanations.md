#### Terms

 - Base INT is the amount of Ability Points added to INT (including the 4 you start with), not including gears nor Maple Warrior

 - Total INT is the amount of INT you have with your gears and Maple Warrior

 - Mana Wash is the act of adding 1 fresh AP into Mana and then using an AP reset scroll to move the point to a main stat (DEX/STR/INT/LUK). Moving the point means losing a set amount of mana, for example archers lose 12 mana

 - Stale Wash is the act of using an AP reset scroll to -MP -> +HP

 - Fresh AP are points you get upon leveling up, you can use these points to increase 6 stats HP/MP/DEX/STR/INT/LUK. 

 - Stale AP are points that will be reset from HP/MP stat into a main stat (DEX/STR/INT/LUK), for example MP -> INT

#### The principles of HP washing:

 - The goal of HP washing is to get as much bonus mana as possible and then stale wash to infinity.
 - Using fresh AP on HP will cause the stat in raise by a random amount, for example if an archer adds a point to HP they get 16~20 HP randomly
 - Using a stale AP on HP, for example -MP -> +HP, will always yield the lowest number so 16 for archers
 - As an archer using fresh AP on MP will yield mana equal to 10 + 10% of your base INT which means that it yields 10% of your base INT - 2 bonus mana, this 2 mana penalty is the same for all classes, for example with 300 base INT every fresh AP in mana yields 28 bonus mana.
 - Upon leveling up your character will get 10% of the total INT as bonus mana, for example 120 total INT will yield 12 bonus mana on lvl up.
That is the reason why before leveling up you need to put on your INT gears and get the Maple Warrior buff.
 - After adding at least 1 point into MP/HP you can stale wash until you are out of mana.

#### Calculator notes:
 - The time needed to vote shown in this calculator is not accurate because the calculation is made with the assumption that you can only get 5k NX a day, however that is not true since you can get 7k NX daily by maxing out your streak (6.5k nx) and using the "blue kimmy" (500nx), not to mention NX drops and vote events.
 - Points in main stat shown in this calculator represent points spent in the 2 main stats of the class, the first 20~35 points need to be put in the primary/secondary stat of your class for the 1st job advancement. for example thief needs 25 points in dex, the secondary stat
 - Every character is a assumed to be created with 10 int and 5 main stat
