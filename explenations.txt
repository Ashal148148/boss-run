this calculator is an estimation, so take it with a grain of slat

The time needed to vote shown in this calculator is not accurate because the calculation is made with the assumption that you can only get 5k NX a day,
however that is not true since you can get 7k NX daily by maxing out your streak (6.5k nx) and using the "blue kimmy" (500nx), not to mention NX drops.

Base INT is the amount of Ability Points added to INT (including the 4 you start with), not including gears nor Maple Warrior

Total INT is the amount of INT you have with your gears and Maple Warrior

Mana Wash is the act of adding 1 fresh AP into Mana and then using an AP reset scroll to move the point to a main stat (DEX/STR/INT/LUK)

Stale Wash is the act of using an AP reset scroll to MP -> HP

Fresh AP are points you get upon leveling up, you can use these points to increase 6 stats HP/MP/DEX/STR/INT/LUK. 

Stale AP are points that will be reset from HP/MP stat into a main stat (DEX/STR/INT/LUK), for example MP -> INT

The principles of HP washing:
the goal of HP washing is to get as much bonus mana as possible and then stale wash to infinity.
using fresh AP on HP will cause the stat in raise by a random amount, for example if an archer adds a point to HP they get 16~20 HP randomly
using a stale AP on HP, for example MP -> HP, will always yield the lowest number so 16 for archers
using fresh AP on MP will yield extra mana equal to 10% of your base INT, for example with 300 base INT every fresh AP in mana yields 30 bonus mana.
upon leveling up your character will get 10% of the total INT as bonus mana, for example 120 total INT will yield 12 bonus mana on lvl up
that is the reason why before leveling up you need to put on your INT gears and get the Maple Warrior buff.
after adding at least 1 point into MP/HP you can stale wash until you are out of mana.

UI explanations:
 - If your class have an HP growth skill (warriors/brawlers) checking this box will make your character add all 5 fresh AP into HP upon lvl up and for each point spent add stale AP
 - while base INT is under the Base INT Goal upon level up add 5 points into INT (stale or fresh, whatever is available)

HP wash automatic planner:
This feature will use the class, gears and Maple Warrior you entered and calculate the cheapest way to reach your HP goal by your lvl goal
The result will tell you what Base INT you should use and how many points to MP wash, how many points to add to HP and how much everything will cost
The calculation will take into account resetting your base INT to 4 once you hit your lvl goal
